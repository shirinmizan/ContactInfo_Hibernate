# ContactInfo_Hibernate

Maven is used in this project to wire dependencies for Hibernate ORM (Object relational mapping). 

In this application we are storing person's contact information. The user's input form is a JSP page which makes request to the servlet to create database  and insert the informations in the database. Hibernate maps the POJO(Plain Old Java Object) to the JSP input data
